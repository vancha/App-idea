Photo editing app

The app must be able to:
  add GEOTAG to images (maybe by selecting them from a map?)
  batch rename apps based on when their picture was taken (eg, two photos taken from different phones, one called DCIM1.png and the other pxl8.jpg, would both be renamed to ddmmyyy-hhmmss.extension)
  preferably it would have some kind of general metadata viewer and editor, and a full "remove all metadata" would be nice too
